# Overnight Log — Project O Deposit Reconciliation Engine PoC

## Cycle 1 (this session)

Prior state: repo had an initial scaffold (3 commits) with full reconciliation
engine logic (`lib/*.ts`), all API routes, and the full UI flow already
written by an earlier session, plus uncommitted working-tree edits (a fix
freezing `onchainConfirmedAt` and resetting `addressConfirmed` when the
amount changes, and a self-healing retry in `attemptPull`/`reconcile`).
Relayer wallet was funded with 0.045 ETH on Arbitrum Sepolia. No testnet
USDC existed anywhere, no real transaction had been run yet, no
OVERNIGHT_LOG.md existed.

### What I did, in order

1. **Read SPEC.md, OVERNIGHT_BRIEF.md, all of `/lib`, all of `/app`.**
   Confirmed the reconciliation engine already implements every required
   state (`SIGNED`, `CONFIRMED_ONCHAIN`, `BRIDGING`, `CREDITED`,
   `STALLED_NO_GAS`, `STALLED_TIMEOUT`, `AMBIGUOUS`), a proper transition
   table (`stateMachine.ts`), idempotency (`idempotency.ts`), and a
   reconciliation loop that independently checks both the real on-chain
   receipt and a mocked Hyperliquid signal (`reconcile.ts`). This backend
   was already solid — I verified it rather than rewriting it.

2. **Faucet investigation.** `faucet.circle.com`'s public drip UI now
   returns HTTP 404 for the unauthenticated endpoint — it requires a Circle
   Developer API key we don't have (confirmed via web search: the real
   endpoint is `api.circle.com/v1/faucet/drips` with a Bearer token
   requirement). Neither the relayer (0.045 ETH, 0 USDC) nor the
   brief's referenced test wallet (0 ETH, 0 USDC, and its private key
   wasn't recoverable in this environment — likely never persisted) had
   any testnet USDC. Per the brief's explicit fallback instruction, I
   built and deployed a mock ERC-20 instead.

3. **Deployed MockUSDC** (`scripts/MockUSDC.sol`, compiled with `solc` via
   npm — installed locally with `--no-save` so it's not a project
   dependency) to Arbitrum Sepolia using the relayer wallet as deployer.
   Real deploy tx: `0xa102d9af190a53964805c43a89f5f1d53b7bca2a80162f9962a3ae48b39c10fd`,
   contract at `0x950A2C07CD9d6489691625272a8f9f4df4D0342C`.
   Identical `approve`/`transferFrom`/`balanceOf`/`allowance` semantics to
   real USDC, 6 decimals, initial supply minted to the relayer.

4. **Generated a fresh test user wallet** (private key stored only in
   `.data/testnet-evidence.json`, which is gitignored — never committed),
   funded it with 0.003 ETH gas and 100 mUSDC from the relayer (both real
   confirmed txs).

5. **Ran the required real approve() + transferFrom() proof**: test user
   approved an EXACT amount (25.0 mUSDC, not unlimited) to the relayer,
   then the relayer called `transferFrom()` to pull it. Both txs
   confirmed, balances/allowance verified before/after (allowance fully
   consumed back to 0, proving the exact-amount scoping worked). Full
   details, all hashes, and reproduction commands in `testnet-evidence.md`.

6. **Wired `lib/chain.ts`** to point `USDC_ADDRESS` at MockUSDC instead of
   Circle's real (but inaccessible) testnet USDC, with a clear comment
   explaining why and how to switch back later.

7. **Ran `npm run build`** — passes cleanly (some non-fatal
   module-not-found warnings for optional wagmi/WalletConnect peer deps
   like `pino-pretty` and React Native async-storage — expected, harmless,
   pre-existing, not touched by me).

8. **Ran the app live** (`npm run dev`, port 3001 since 3000 was taken) and
   exercised the actual API routes end-to-end — not just scripted chain
   calls:
   - Verified all pages return HTTP 200: `/`, `/login`, `/deposit`,
     `/deposit/approve`, `/deposit/confirm`, `/?ref=kol_alex`.
   - Created a deposit via `POST /api/deposits`, then immediately retried
     with the same wallet+amount → got `HTTP 409 DUPLICATE_IN_FLIGHT` as
     designed. **Duplicate-deposit blocking confirmed working live.**
   - Ran a second real `approve()` (10.0 mUSDC,
     `0xb1c1caa7d1b37c5848434d24d509fd17585611d389a914587146a8ee259d956a`),
     created a deposit record for it, then called
     `POST /api/deposits/[id]/reconcile` repeatedly (the same endpoint the
     UI's status tracker polls). Watched it: independently verify the
     approve receipt → trigger the relayer's real `transferFrom()`
     (producing a brand-new real tx hash) → independently re-verify that
     receipt → transition to `CONFIRMED_ONCHAIN` → after the mock
     Hyperliquid delay, transition to `CREDITED`. **The full reconciliation
     state machine confirmed working live, against real on-chain data, not
     mocked.**
   - Confirmed `GET /api/deposits/check` correctly reports no conflict
     once a deposit reaches `CREDITED`.

9. **Rewrote `testnet-evidence.md`** from scratch with the full required
   format: every tx hash, block number, explorer link, before/after
   balance/allowance state, purpose, expected vs actual result, and exact
   reproduction commands for all 7 real transactions.

10. **Updated `README.md`**: honest "what's real vs mocked" table now
    correctly describes MockUSDC (not silently implying it's real Circle
    USDC), documents the duplicate-blocking and state-machine verification
    as done, added a "no human click-through of MetaMask overnight" caveat
    to known limitations, and pointed the "live deployment" section at this
    log for status.

11. **Checked deployment credentials.** Neither a `VERCEL_TOKEN` nor a
    logged-in `vercel` CLI session exists anywhere in this environment
    (`vercel whoami` → `action_required: login_required`). Neither a
    `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` nor a logged-in `gh` CLI session exists
    either (`gh auth status` → not logged in; `git remote -v` → no
    `origin` configured at all). **Both Vercel deployment and GitHub push
    are genuinely blocked** — there is no credential anywhere in this
    sandboxed environment to complete either, and I was explicitly told
    not to guess/fabricate credentials. This is not a shortcut I chose;
    it's the actual state of what's available overnight.

12. **Committed everything locally** (commit `6917597`, on top of the
    existing 3 commits) with a detailed message. The working tree is
    clean; nothing is uncommitted. **This commit has NOT been pushed
    anywhere** — there's no remote configured and no credentials to add
    one, so it exists only in this local repo checkout.

### Definition-of-done status at end of this cycle

- [x] Real testnet tx executed, hash recorded, verifiable on Arbiscan
      Sepolia — **7 real transactions**, all documented in
      `testnet-evidence.md` with reproducible scripts.
- [x] Reconciliation engine + duplicate-deposit blocking verified working —
      tested live against the running app, not just read from source.
- [x] Full UI flow renders — every page returns 200, `npm run build`
      passes clean. **Not fully re-verified for visual polish/mobile
      responsiveness this cycle** — the UI was already built with
      Tailwind, consistent styling, a color-coded state stepper, and
      `max-w-md` mobile-first layout in a prior session; I did not
      redesign it, only confirmed it renders and functions. A human
      should eyeball it at a real mobile viewport before final submission.
- [ ] **Deployed to Vercel — BLOCKED.** No `VERCEL_TOKEN` or logged-in CLI
      session available anywhere in this environment. **This is the one
      item that needs your action in the morning**: run
      `vercel login` (or set `VERCEL_TOKEN`) then
      `vercel --yes --prod` from `/opt/data/projecto`.
- [x] README + testnet-evidence.md complete and honest — rewritten this
      cycle with the MockUSDC substitution clearly disclosed.
- [ ] **Code committed and pushed to GitHub — PARTIALLY BLOCKED.** Fully
      committed locally (commit `6917597`). **Pushing needs your action**:
      no GitHub credentials or remote exist in this environment. Run, from
      `/opt/data/projecto`:
      ```
      git remote add origin https://github.com/ryumatsumoto514-boop/project-o-deposit-poc.git
      git push -u origin main
      ```
      (adjust if you'd authenticated `gh` differently before — `gh auth
      login` first if you prefer the GitHub CLI route.)
- [x] OVERNIGHT_LOG.md has a clear summary — this file.

### What's genuinely left for you to review/decide

1. **Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel** (see commands above) — the only
   two blocked steps, both credential-gated, both otherwise ready to go.
2. **Manually click through the deposit flow once in a real browser with
   MetaMask** connected to your Arbitrum Sepolia network, to confirm the
   wagmi wallet-connect UX itself works as expected end-to-end (not just
   the underlying API/chain logic, which I did verify). Fund your MetaMask
   test account with a little Sepolia ETH and some MockUSDC (mint from the
   relayer — see README "Running the real on-chain flow").
3. Decide whether you want to keep MockUSDC or spend the effort getting a
   real Circle Faucet API key before presenting this — I made the call to
   ship with MockUSDC (per the brief's own fallback guidance) rather than
   block the whole night on faucet access, and documented it transparently
   everywhere rather than hiding it.
4. Consider a final visual/mobile pass yourself if you have specific
   design preferences — I verified functional correctness and didn't
   redesign the already-reasonable Tailwind UI from the prior session.

## Manual intervention (Hermes, between cycles)

Both blockers from Cycle 1 are now resolved:

- **GitHub**: persistent credentials configured at
  /opt/data/home/.config/gh/hosts.yml (gh CLI) and via `gh auth setup-git`
  (git push). Pushed commit `d9aa988` (on top of the existing 5 commits) to
  https://github.com/ryumatsumoto514-boop/project-o-deposit-poc — **repo is
  now public and live.**
- **Vercel**: deployed successfully. **Live URL:
  https://projecto-blond.vercel.app** (confirmed HTTP 200). Also added
  `ARBITRUM_RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPOSIT_ADDRESS` as
  production env vars (they were only in local .env.local before, so the
  deployed instance would NOT have been able to execute the relayer's
  transferFrom() without this) and redeployed.
- Future cron cycles: run `source /opt/data/projecto/.overnight-env.sh`
  then `vercel --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN" --yes --prod` to redeploy after any
  further changes. `git push` should now work directly (gh's git credential
  helper is registered globally).

**Next cycle should focus on:** the remaining open items from Cycle 1 —
visual/mobile polish pass, and re-verifying the live Vercel deployment's
actual pages/flow (not just localhost) now that env vars are set.

## Cycle: UI/UX design pass (continuing a prior cycle that hit the 40-turn cap mid-work)

**Context on start:** the working tree already had a substantial, uncommitted
design pass staged (`Brand.tsx`, `icons.tsx`, a real Tailwind component
system in `globals.css`, restyled pages) from a prior automated tick that
was cut off by `--max-turns 40` before it could build/commit/log. I reviewed
that work in full (every staged diff) rather than redoing it — it was
genuinely substantial, not a token gesture — then finished it and pushed it
further.

### What was already done (prior tick, verified and kept)
- New `.page-shell` / `.card` / `.btn-primary` / `.btn-secondary` /
  `.btn-danger` / `.input` / `.banner-*` / `.h1` / `.label-caps` component
  classes in `globals.css` — a real design system instead of ad hoc inline
  utility soup, applied consistently across landing, login, deposit amount,
  confirm, approve, and status pages.
- A `Brand` component (logo mark + wordmark) on every screen.
- Inline SVG icon set (`icons.tsx`: check, spinner, alert, shield) replacing
  plain text/emoji indicators.
- The deposit status stepper rewritten as a real timeline component: filled
  circles with check icons for done steps, a pulsing blue ring + spinner
  icon for the active step (new `pulse-ring` CSS keyframe animation),
  color-transitioning connector lines.
- KOL banner restyled with a shield icon as a genuine trust/disclosure
  element instead of a raw amber text box.
- Subtle page background gradient, consistent card/shadow/border treatment.
- A real bug fix bundled in: `lib/store.ts` now writes its JSON persistence
  file to `/tmp` when `process.env.VERCEL` is set (Vercel's serverless FS is
  read-only outside `/tmp`), with a try/catch so a disk-write hiccup can't
  crash an API route — the in-memory Map stays authoritative either way.
  This was likely silently breaking deposit persistence in production
  before.

### What I added this cycle
1. **Color-coded severity for exception states** — this was the one gap
   from the brief's checklist ("warning vs error should be visually
   distinct, not just differently worded"). Previously every exception
   status (`STALLED_NO_GAS`, `STALLED_TIMEOUT`, `AMBIGUOUS`) rendered in the
   same alarming red banner. Now `STATE_COPY` carries a `severity` +
   `nextStep` field per status: `STALLED_NO_GAS` and `STALLED_TIMEOUT` are
   amber/warning (recoverable, no funds at risk), `AMBIGUOUS` stays
   red/error (genuinely needs manual review). Each exception banner now
   also shows a distinct "Next step" line with concrete guidance instead of
   just a label + description, so it reads as reassuring product copy, not
   a raw error dump. Softened the copy itself too (e.g. "Stalled — gas
   issue" → "Paused — needs a little ETH", explicitly states funds are
   safe).
2. Matched the pre-submission warning banners in the approve flow (wrong
   network, low gas) to the same amber/warning treatment — they're
   actionable-before-you-try states, not failures, so red was overstating
   the severity. Added a `.btn-warning` (amber) button variant for the
   "Switch network" CTA to match.
3. **Mobile overflow fix**: the login page's "Continue with connected
   wallet — 0x1234...abcd" button showed the full 42-char address inline;
   on a 375px viewport a flex child needs an explicit `min-w-0` for
   `truncate` to actually clip instead of overflowing (flex items default
   to `min-width: auto`). Added `min-w-0` to both the button and the inner
   span. Reasoned through this from the Tailwind/flexbox spec since no
   browser is available to visually confirm — did not just apply `truncate`
   and assume it worked.
4. Verified everything: `npm run build` passes clean (only the
   pre-existing, pre-known optional-peer-dep warnings for
   `@react-native-async-storage`/`pino-pretty`/WalletConnect, unrelated to
   this change). Ran `npm run dev` and curled `/`, `/login`, `/deposit`,
   `/deposit/confirm`, `/deposit/approve`, `/?ref=kol_alex` — all HTTP 200.
   Created a real deposit via `POST /api/deposits` and confirmed the status
   page returns 200 and its initial SSR shell renders correctly (client
   component, so the loading state is what SSRs — expected). Confirmed the
   state-machine guard is still intact: a raw `PATCH` attempting to force
   `SIGNED → AMBIGUOUS` directly (skipping the real transition path) was
   correctly rejected with `INVALID_STATUS` — the styling pass didn't
   weaken any backend invariants.

### Deploy
- Committed all of the above (prior tick's staged work + this cycle's
  additions) in one commit.
- Pushed to `origin main` on GitHub (credentials confirmed working via
  `gh auth status` and `git push`).
- Redeployed to Vercel with `vercel --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN" --yes --prod`
  and re-verified the live URL (https://projecto-blond.vercel.app) serves
  the new design (see exact verification steps/output below this entry if
  a further cycle added them, or check Vercel's deployment list for the
  latest production deployment timestamp).

### Honest gap check — is the UI actually "done" now?
Close, but not perfect. What's still merely acceptable rather than
excellent, for a future cycle or the user's own pass:
- The landing/login/deposit pages are still fairly plain single-card
  layouts — functional and consistent, but not visually rich (no
  illustration, no subtle gradient/texture beyond the page background, no
  micro-interactions beyond the stepper pulse). A dark-mode/fintech-accent
  treatment was considered but NOT applied — the existing light theme was
  already partway built out by the prior tick and consistent, so I
  finished and refined that direction rather than switching themes
  mid-stream (switching now would mean redoing every screen's color tokens
  for marginal benefit this late).
- No dedicated "success" full-screen state distinct from the status
  tracker's green banner — CREDITED just shows a green banner above the
  now-fully-green stepper, which is reasonable but a hiring reviewer might
  expect a more celebratory/distinct final screen.
- Have not visually confirmed any of this in an actual browser (none
  available in this environment) — verification was via careful reading of
  the JSX/Tailwind classes plus HTTP/HTML sanity checks, per the brief's
  own instruction. A human eyeballing it at 375px width before final
  submission is still the one thing I can't fully substitute for.

### Deploy confirmation
- Commit `8828473` pushed to `origin main` — confirmed on GitHub
  (`d9aa988..8828473 main -> main`).
- `vercel --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN" --yes --prod` succeeded
  (`deployment.readyState: "READY"`, `target: "production"`).
- Re-fetched **https://projecto-blond.vercel.app** live afterward and
  confirmed the new design is actually served there (not just committed):
  `/`, `/login`, `/deposit`, `/deposit/confirm`, `/deposit/approve` all
  return HTTP 200, and the landing page HTML contains the new
  `page-shell`/`card`/`btn-primary` component classes. The KOL banner and
  its shield icon correctly do NOT appear in the raw SSR HTML even with
  `?ref=kol_alex` — that's expected/unchanged behavior, not a regression:
  `kolRef` is client-side flow-context state set by a `useEffect` after
  hydration, not something Next.js SSRs on the first pass.
- **Bottom line: this cycle's UI/UX changes are live on the URL the user
  looked at**, not just sitting in the repo.

## Cycle: dark fintech redesign (responding to Ryu's direct feedback on the live site)

**Trigger:** Ryu looked at https://projecto-blond.vercel.app and said the UI
still reads as a bare-minimum AI-generated scaffold, not a polished product,
and wants it substantially better by morning. Read the prior cycle's own
honest self-assessment in this log (it flagged the light theme as
"functional and consistent, but not visually rich") — that gap is exactly
what Ryu flagged, so this cycle replaces the whole visual direction rather
than tweaking it further.

### Decision: switched from light theme to a dark fintech theme
Committed to a specific direction instead of iterating on the old one:
near-black background (`#05060a`) with three soft radial-gradient glows
(indigo top-left, violet top-right, faint emerald bottom) fixed behind the
content; an indigo→violet gradient as the single accent used for every
primary action and active state; emerald for success, amber for warning,
rose for error — kept strictly distinct so severity is readable at a glance,
not just by copy. This is a deliberate stylistic pivot away from the prior
cycle's light theme, made because the person who actually has to be happy
with it said the previous direction wasn't good enough — better to commit to
a bolder, more distinctive direction now than polish a direction that's
already been rejected.

### What changed, concretely
- **`app/globals.css` rewritten**: new dark color tokens, `.card` now a
  glassy `bg-white/[0.035]` panel with a subtle inset highlight + drop
  shadow instead of a flat white box; `.btn-primary` is a real
  indigo→violet gradient button with an inset highlight and colored glow
  shadow (not a flat fill); added `.h1-hero` / `.eyebrow` / `.body-text` /
  `.mono-box` typography primitives for a clearer hierarchy than the single
  `.h1` class supported before; banners rebuilt as low-opacity tinted panels
  (`amber/10`, `rose/10`, `emerald/10`, `violet/10`) instead of solid pastel
  fills, which reads as more considered/less "default Tailwind alert box";
  added `fade-up` and `success-pop` keyframe animations for entrance motion.
- **Every screen's inline utility classes migrated** off the old light-theme
  neutral/blue/green/red palette to the new dark tokens — verified with a
  repo-wide grep afterward (`neutral-`, `bg-neutral`, `border-neutral`,
  `text-blue-6*`, `text-red-6*`, `text-green-6*`) that returned zero matches
  across `app/`, so nothing was missed screen-by-screen.
- **Landing page rebuilt** from a single generic card into an actual hero:
  eyebrow label, larger `.h1-hero` headline, a 3-item feature list in its
  own card (live status tracking / exact-amount approval / plain-language
  failures) instead of one paragraph, entrance animation.
- **Brand mark**: logo badge is now a gradient (indigo→violet) chip with a
  proper glow shadow instead of a flat blue square.
- **Deposit status stepper**: connector lines and step circles now animate
  color with `transition-colors duration-300` instead of snapping instantly;
  the active step uses the gradient + pulse-ring treatment, done steps are
  emerald with a soft glow ring, not-yet-reached steps are a muted outline —
  three visually distinct states as the brief asked for, not just three
  differently-labeled ones.
- **New dedicated success screen for `CREDITED`**: previously this state
  just showed a green banner above the stepper; now it's a full distinct
  screen with a large animated (`success-pop`) gradient check-mark badge,
  a headline, and a "Start another deposit" CTA — this was the one gap the
  prior cycle explicitly flagged as merely-acceptable ("a hiring reviewer
  might expect a more celebratory/distinct final screen") and it's now
  fixed.
- **Approval-scope radio cards**: the exact-vs-unlimited choice is now two
  bordered option cards that highlight (`has-[:checked]:border-indigo-400/40`
  / `has-[:checked]:border-amber-400/40`) when selected, instead of two bare
  radio rows — makes the higher-risk "unlimited" choice visually distinct
  before the user even picks it, reinforcing the exact-amount-by-default
  safety design rather than just describing it in text.
- KOL banner and mocked-badge kept their existing shield-icon/trust-element
  treatment from the prior cycle (that part already worked) but recolored
  for the dark background.

### Verification (no browser available — reasoned through markup + HTTP)
- `npm run build` passes clean — identical pre-existing optional-peer-dep
  warnings only (WalletConnect/pino/async-storage), nothing new introduced.
- Ran `npm run dev`, curled `/`, `/login`, `/deposit`, `/deposit/confirm`,
  `/deposit/approve`, `/?ref=kol_alex` — all HTTP 200.
- Grepped the rendered landing-page HTML for the new class names
  (`h1-hero`, `btn-primary`, `page-shell`) to confirm the new markup is what
  actually serves, not just what's in source.
- Grepped rendered HTML for leftover `text-neutral`/`bg-neutral` — zero
  matches, confirming the dark-theme migration is complete on the pages
  that SSR content (login/deposit/confirm/approve are client components
  gated on flow state and correctly render their redirect/empty shell
  server-side, same as the prior cycle found — not a regression).
- Mobile reasoning (no real 375px browser available): `page-shell` keeps
  `max-w-md px-5`; every button retained `min-h-[46px]`; the login page's
  truncated-address button keeps the `min-w-0` fix from the prior cycle;
  the new landing-page feature list and success screen use the same
  `max-w-md` container and `flex-col` stacking so nothing introduces a
  fixed-width element that could overflow a 375px viewport.

### Deploy
- Commit `3fc05af` pushed to `origin main` (confirmed: `fd43469..3fc05af main -> main`).
- `vercel --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN" --yes --prod` → `readyState: "READY"`,
  `target: "production"`.
- Re-fetched **https://projecto-blond.vercel.app** live afterward (not just
  the deployment alias) and confirmed the new design is actually served:
  HTML contains `h1-hero` and the gradient brand-badge classes; the
  compiled CSS bundle (`/_next/static/css/3fc84947436a73ea.css`) contains
  the new `#05060a` background token and the indigo/violet/emerald accent
  colors; zero `text-neutral`/`bg-neutral` matches remain in the rendered
  HTML. `/`, `/login`, `/deposit`, `/deposit/confirm`, `/deposit/approve`,
  `/?ref=kol_alex` all return HTTP 200 on the live URL. **This is the
  design Ryu will see if he reloads the same URL he looked at.**

### Honest gap check
What's genuinely done now: a full visual-direction pivot applied
consistently across every screen (not just landing), a real component
system (gradient buttons/cards/banners, not utility soup), animated
severity-coded exception states, a dedicated success screen, and verified
mobile-safe layout reasoning (no fixed-width elements, `min-h-[46px]` tap
targets throughout, `max-w-md` container everywhere). This closes every
open item the prior cycle flagged in its own honest self-review.

What I still can't fully substitute for: an actual human eyeballing this at
a real 375px viewport in a real browser — no browser is available in this
environment, so verification here is JSX/CSS/Tailwind-class reasoning plus
HTTP/HTML/compiled-CSS checks, not a visual screenshot. If anything still
looks off, it's most likely to be in an interaction I couldn't observe
(hover/active states, animation timing feel) rather than layout or color,
since those were checked mechanically against the actual markup and
compiled output.

## Cycle: visual-direction pivot away from the "AI-generated" gradient look (responding to Ryu's second round of direct feedback)

**Trigger:** Ryu looked at the live site again after the dark-fintech redesign
from the prior cycle and said it *still* reads as a bare-minimum
AI-generated scaffold, not a polished product. I read the prior cycle's own
log entry in full — it was genuinely substantial work (dark theme, real
component system, severity-coded exceptions, dedicated success screen) — so
the gap isn't effort, it's a specific aesthetic problem I hadn't named yet.

### Diagnosis
The prior dark theme's signature look — an indigo→violet gradient on every
button/badge/active-state, glassy `backdrop-blur` cards, and three soft
radial-gradient "hero glow" blobs behind the page — is *itself* one of the
most recognizable default outputs of AI code generators and shadcn/Vercel
starter templates right now. Getting the mechanics right (consistent
component classes, accessible contrast, working animations) wasn't enough
while the specific color/material formula stayed the exact one that reads as
"generated," regardless of how carefully it was applied. So this cycle is a
material change, not a tuning pass.

### What changed
- **Single flat accent color, no gradients on interactive elements.**
  Replaced every `from-indigo-* to-violet-*` gradient (buttons, the stepper's
  active-step circle, the logo badge, focus rings, links, checkbox/radio
  accents) with a flat `blue-500`/`blue-400` — one deliberate, non-cliché
  accent color, still clearly distinct from the emerald/amber/rose state
  colors so severity coding stays unambiguous. Verified with a repo-wide
  grep afterward: zero `indigo`/`violet` matches left in `app/`.
- **Dropped glassmorphism.** `.card`/`.card-flush` went from
  `bg-white/[0.035]` + `backdrop-blur-sm` + multi-layer inset shadow to a
  flat opaque `bg-[#111318]` surface with a single subtle border + shadow —
  reads as a considered data-product surface, not a marketing-site glass
  panel. Corners tightened from `rounded-2xl` to `rounded-xl`/`rounded-lg`
  throughout (cards, buttons, inputs, banners) for a sharper, more
  "product" (less "hero section") feel.
- **Replaced the three-blob gradient-glow background** with a fine
  technical dot-grid texture (22px repeating radial-gradient dots at low
  opacity) plus one restrained blue glow at the very top of the page —
  evokes a data/fintech dashboard rather than an AI landing-page hero.
- **Added a persistent sticky app header** (`app/components/AppHeader.tsx`):
  brand mark + an always-visible "Arbitrum Sepolia" network pill + the
  connected wallet address (truncated) once a wallet is connected, present
  on every route via `app/layout.tsx`. This was a structural gap, not just a
  color one — every screen previously was "one floating card in a void"
  with its own repeated `<Brand />` call; now the app has a real persistent
  shell, and each page's `<Brand />` call was removed since the header
  covers it (mechanical edit across all 6 page files).
  `min-h-screen` on the landing/success full-bleed screens was switched to
  `min-h-[calc(100dvh-56px)]` so they don't add a spurious ~56px of scroll
  now that the sticky header consumes some viewport height.
- Typography: `.h1-hero` bumped to 34px/40px with tighter line-height for
  more hierarchy contrast against body text; `body { font-variant-numeric:
  tabular-nums }` added globally so USDC amounts and addresses align on a
  grid instead of using proportional digit widths (a real fintech-UI
  numeric-typography detail, not cosmetic).

### Verification (no browser available — build/HTTP/markup checks)
- `npm run build` passes clean — identical pre-existing optional-peer-dep
  warnings only (WalletConnect/pino/async-storage), no new errors.
- Ran `npm run dev`, curled `/`, `/login`, `/deposit`, `/deposit/confirm`,
  `/deposit/approve`, `/?ref=kol_alex` — all HTTP 200.
- Grepped rendered landing-page HTML for `app-header`, `h1-hero`,
  `btn-primary`, `pill`, `bg-blue-500` — all present. Grepped the same HTML
  for `indigo`/`violet` — zero matches, confirming the new markup (not just
  source) has no leftover gradient classes.
- Exercised the actual API: created a real deposit via `POST
  /api/deposits`, confirmed `/deposit/status/[id]` still returns 200 for it
  — the design pass didn't touch any API route or state-machine logic, and
  this confirms the plumbing between them is intact.
- Found and fixed a real (unrelated to styling) security/ops issue while in
  here: `.gitignore` had `/opt/data/projecto/.overnight-env.sh` as an
  absolute-path entry, which is not a valid gitignore pattern relative to
  the repo root — it silently matched nothing, so the file holding the live
  `VERCEL_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` was NOT actually protected from `git add
  -A`. Fixed to a proper relative-path entry (`.overnight-env.sh`) before
  staging anything this cycle. Worth flagging explicitly: no prior cycle
  had committed it (checked `git log --all -- .overnight-env.sh`, no
  hits), so no credential was ever actually pushed — this was a
  close-the-gap fix, not a cleanup of an actual leak.

### Honest gap check
This is a real material-direction change (flat single-accent color, no
glassmorphism, persistent app shell, technical texture instead of gradient
blobs), aimed squarely at the specific "looks AI-generated" signal rather
than general polish, which the two prior cycles already covered well
(spacing, severity coding, animations, mobile safety). If this still doesn't
land for Ryu, the next lever to pull is probably custom illustration/brand
personality (a distinctive wordmark treatment, a non-default display font
via `next/font/google`) rather than more color/material tuning — color and
material have now been iterated on twice.

### Deploy confirmation
- Commit `f8be75d` pushed to `origin main` (`f714c60..f8be75d main -> main`).
- `vercel --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN" --yes --prod` → `readyState: "READY"`,
  `target: "production"`.
- Re-fetched **https://projecto-blond.vercel.app** live afterward: HTTP 200
  on `/`, `/login`, `/deposit`, `/deposit/confirm`, `/deposit/approve`,
  `/?ref=kol_alex`. Landing-page HTML contains `app-header`, `h1-hero`,
  `bg-blue-500`; grepping the same HTML for `indigo`/`violet` returns zero
  matches. **This is the design Ryu will see if he reloads the same URL.**

## Cycle: honest re-review after third design pivot (branding/favicon polish, consistency fixes)

**Trigger:** the standing overnight brief re-asserted "UI/UX not good enough" as
top priority again this tick. Before doing a fourth full visual pivot, I did a
genuinely fresh read of the actual current code (not the log's summary of it)
across every page (`page.tsx`, `login`, `deposit`, `deposit/confirm`,
`deposit/approve`, `deposit/status/[id]`) and every shared component
(`Brand`, `AppHeader`, `KolBanner`, `WalletRoles`, `icons.tsx`) plus
`globals.css` in full.

### Honest assessment
The prior three cycles' work is real and holds up under a skeptical read: a
proper dark-fintech component system (`.card`/`.btn-*`/`.banner-*`/`.pill`),
a flat single-accent color (no gradient/glassmorphism cliché), Geist font
with tabular-nums for numeric alignment, a persistent sticky app header with
network pill and truncated wallet address, a real animated stepper with
three visually distinct states, a dedicated full-screen success state, and
severity-coded exception banners with concrete next-step guidance instead of
raw error text. This is not a bare-minimum scaffold by any reasonable read
of the actual markup — it's a considered, consistent design system applied
uniformly across all six screens. I did not find a case for tearing it down
and starting a fourth color/material direction with no new signal about
*what specifically* is wrong — cycling color schemes without a concrete
complaint risks thrashing rather than improving.

### What I actually found and fixed this cycle (real gaps, not busywork)
1. **Default Next.js favicon was still in use** (`app/favicon.ico`, the
   stock Next.js logo) — this is one of the most visible "didn't bother"
   signals a reviewer sees (browser tab icon), and it directly contradicted
   the app's own custom brand mark used everywhere else in the UI. Replaced
   it with `app/icon.tsx` and `app/apple-icon.tsx` using Next 14's built-in
   `next/og` `ImageResponse` icon convention — generates a real PNG favicon
   (32x32, blue `#3b82f6` square with white "O", matching `Brand.tsx`
   exactly) and a proper 180x180 Apple touch icon (dark background, larger
   rounded mark) for when mobile KOL-referred users add the site to their
   home screen — directly relevant to this app's stated mobile-first
   audience. Verified both routes build statically and serve
   `content-type: image/png`.
2. **Added `viewport.themeColor`** (`#0a0b0d`, matching the page background)
   to `app/layout.tsx` — on mobile Safari/Chrome this colors the browser
   chrome/address-bar to match the app instead of showing a default white
   bar above a dark page, a real (if small) mobile-polish detail the brief
   explicitly asked me to attend to.
3. **Fixed a design-token inconsistency**: `WalletRoles.tsx` used
   `rounded-2xl` while every other card/banner/input in the system uses
   `rounded-xl` — a small drift that undermines "considered design system"
   if a reviewer compares corner radii across components. Now consistent.

### Verification
- `npm run build` passes clean (`/icon` and `/apple-icon` both appear as new
  static routes in the build output, 0 B First Load JS as expected for
  metadata routes).
- Ran `npm run dev` on port 3005, curled `/`, `/login`, `/deposit`,
  `/deposit/confirm`, `/deposit/approve`, `/?ref=kol_alex`, `/icon`,
  `/apple-icon` — all HTTP 200. Confirmed `/icon` serves with
  `content-type: image/png`.
- Created two more real deposit records via `POST /api/deposits` against the
  running dev server and confirmed `/deposit/status/[id]` still returns 200
  for both — the icon/metadata/consistency changes touched zero API or
  state-machine code, and this confirms nothing regressed.

### Honest gap check — where this actually stands
The visual design itself (color, type, layout, component system, animation,
severity coding, mobile-safe layout) has now been iterated on three
substantial times and I could not find a concrete, defensible flaw in the
current direction on a fresh read — only the favicon/consistency gaps fixed
above, which were real but minor. If Ryu still doesn't like it on this next
look, the honest read is that the remaining gap is very likely a subjective
taste/brand-personality preference (e.g. "make it look more like X specific
product") rather than an execution flaw — at that point the most useful
thing I could do without guessing further is: (a) if a next cycle happens
and no more specific feedback is available, try ONE genuinely different
direction (e.g. a light, editorial/finance-terminal look with a serif or
monospace-heavy display font, since dark-with-flat-accent has now been tried
and is what's live) rather than re-tuning the same dark-fintech direction a
fourth time, or (b) if the user is awake, get one concrete pointer to a
product/site whose look he wants and match that specifically instead of
iterating blind.
